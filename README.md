# libcvrabootloader

This repository contains C++ bindings and example programs,
which together with my [CAN interface library](https://github.com/matthiasbock/libcan),
enable communication with [my fork of CVRA's CAN bootloader](https://github.com/matthiasbock/cvra-bootloader).
Possibly the original CVRA bootloader too,
but I can't guarantee that,
because I'm a bit behind
with the generation of pull requests
for my changes.
